# Cortical Folding Humans: deaging and harmonization procedures description
Description of the deaging and harmonization procedures for cortical folding variables (and known morphological variables).

Here is the description and example code of the deaging and harmonization procedures present in de Moraes et al., *in submission* and de Moraes et al, *in preparation*.
The deaging is a simple procedure of regression out the age effect from cortical folding variables. The harmonization allows combining and analyzing multiple datasets by removing the Type II Error. 

The data used here are from [Supporting dataset underlying "Human cortical folding across regions within individual brains follows universal scaling law"](https://zenodo.org/record/2595060), and processed data from [AHEAD](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811920306868) and [AOMIC (PIOP1 and PIOP2)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00870-6) (to be uploaded).
